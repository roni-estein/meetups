# meetup logs
Just a small repo that e can all easily contribute to log any really juicy bits of info from our monthly Livewire meetups. If we (or someone else in our orbit) do any other meetups, I'd be happy to include them here or someone. 

Some really great ideas got sparked in my head during the meetup, and for those who couldn't make it, I wanted a place where you could at least find the same spark starting points.

One person can't remember everything and make this as robust as possible, and I thought we could make this a simple MD system for easy contribution. Everyone can contribute what they remember. Also, I added a little area for fact-checking. Sometimes we are just "remembering something" but are not looking at code. If someone is gracious enough to flesh out talking parts with some code examples or links, that would be a great contribution to this little project that would be helpful.

 I can start to build a site around this in a week or two. 
 
 Perhaps even as a screencast ;) 
 
 With my crappy mic.
